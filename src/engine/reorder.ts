/**
 * Move an alert, deciding its group from where it lands.
 *
 * Groups are contiguous runs rather than a separate tree, which keeps the data
 * model flat and the rules predictable:
 *
 *  - dropping BETWEEN two alerts of the same group joins that group;
 *  - dropping at any other boundary leaves the alert ungrouped, which is what
 *    makes "drag it out" work without a separate ungroup gesture;
 *  - dropping ONTO an alert joins its group, creating one if it had none.
 *
 * Returns a new array; the input is not mutated.
